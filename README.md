# Custom-Reverse-Proxy-Load-Balancer
A lightweight, Node.js-based reverse proxy and load balancing system designed to distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers using a round-robin algorithm. This project simulates a real production architecture with three load balancers and two backend servers, demonstrating concepts like scalability and traffic routing.
